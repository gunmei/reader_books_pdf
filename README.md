# reader_books_pdf
This program is one of my graduation papers. In the program, you can open any pdf document and view it. 
The program also allows you to make some changes from documents for easy viewing: turn left and right, 
  change the zoom, buttons for switching pages, the ability to print a page, 
  and also render each of all pages of the document into a bitmap.  
This program is designed to consolidate the acquired skills and knowledge during the educational process.

For the stabel work you need installed:
- Microsoft Office Access 2016
- NET Framework 4.8.04084
- Microsoft Visual Studio ProfessionalÂ 2019 (C#  Forms)
- A component for working with forms and applications "C#" must be installed,
  + called "Development of classic applications .NET"

The program is written for a Russian-speaking audience, so there is no English in this program. 
The entire interface is in Russian, while you can open files with the extension.pdf containing in the title and inside written in English.
